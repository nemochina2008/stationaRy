\title{Get listing of ISD stations based on location or time bounds}
\usage{
get_isd_stations(startyear = NULL, endyear = NULL, lower_lat = NULL,
  upper_lat = NULL, lower_lon = NULL, upper_lon = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{startyear}{the starting year for the collected data.}

\item{endyear}{the ending year for the collected data.}

\item{lower_lat}{the lower bound of the latitude for a bounding box.}

\item{upper_lat}{the upper bound of the latitude for a bounding box.}

\item{lower_lon}{the lower bound of the longitude for a bounding box.}

\item{upper_lon}{the upper bound of the longitude for a bounding box.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with 16 columns.
\describe{
  \item{usaf}{A character string identifying the fixed weather 
    station from the USAF Master Station Catalog.
    USAF is an acronym for United States Air Force.}
  \item{wban}{A character string for the fixed weather
    station NCDC WBAN identifier.  
    NCDC is an acronym for National Climatic Data Center. 
    WBAN is an acronym for Weather Bureau, Air Force and Navy.}
  \item{name}{A character string with the station name.}
  \item{country}{A character string with the two character country 
    code where the station is located. Not identical to \code{country_code}.}
  \item{state}{Character string of the two character abbreviation of a US 
    state (when applicable).}
  \item{lat}{Latitude (degrees) rounded to three decimal places.}
  \item{lon}{Longitude (degrees) rounded to three decimal places.}
  \item{elev}{Numeric value for the elevation as measured in meters. 
    The minimum value is -400 with a maximum of 8850. Elevation in feet
    can be approximated by \code{elev * 3.28084}}
  \item{begin}{The earliest year for which data are available.}
  \item{end}{The latest year for which data are available.}
  \item{gmt_offset}{A time zone offset.}
  \item{time_zone_id}{Time zone identifier}
  \item{country_name}{Character string giving the name of the country 
    where the station is located.}
  \item{country_code}{A character string with the two character country 
    code where the station is located. This is not identical to the 
    \code{country} column.}
  \item{iso3166_2_subd}{The ISO 3166-2 representation of the country's
  subdivision (e.g., state, province, etc.) for where the station is 
  located.}
  \item{fips10_4_subd}{The FIPS 10-4 representation of the country's
  subdivision (e.g., state, province, etc.) for where the station is 
  located.}
