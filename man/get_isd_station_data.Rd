\usage{
get_isd_station_data(station_id, startyear, endyear, full_data = FALSE,
  add_data_report = FALSE, select_additional_data = NULL,
  use_local_files = FALSE, local_file_dir = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{station_id}{a station identifier composed of the station's USAF and
WBAN numbers, separated by a hyphen.}

\item{startyear}{the starting year for the collected data.}

\item{endyear}{the ending year for the collected data.}

\item{full_data}{include additional meteorological data found in the
dataset's additional data section?}

\item{add_data_report}{selecting TRUE will provide a data frame with
information on which additional data categories are available for the
selected station during the specified years.}

\item{select_additional_data}{a vector of categories for additional
meteorological data to include (instead of all available categories).}

\item{use_local_files}{option to use data files already available locally.}

\item{local_file_dir}{path to local meteorological data files.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with 18 variables. Times are recorded 
using the Universal Time Code (UTC) in the source data. Times are adjusted
to local standard time for the station's locale.
\describe{
  \item{usaf}{A character string identifying the fixed weather 
    station from the USAF Master Station Catalog.
    USAF is an acronym for United States Air Force.}
  \item{wban}{A character string for the fixed weather
    station NCDC WBAN identifier.  
    NCDC is an acronym for National Climatic Data Center. 
    WBAN is an acronym for Weather Bureau, Air Force and Navy.}
  \item{year}{A numeric, four digit value giving the year of the 
    observation.}
  \item{month}{A numeric value (one or two digits) giving the month
    of the observation.}
  \item{day}{A numeric value (one or two digits) giving the day of the 
    month of the observation.}
  \item{hour}{A numeric value (one or two digits) giving the hour of 
    the observation.}
  \item{minute}{A numeric value (one or two digits) giving the minute 
    of the hour in which the observation was recorded.}
  \item{lat}{Latitude (degrees) rounded to three decimal places.}
  \item{lon}{Longitude (degrees) rounded to three decimal places.}
  \item{elev}{Numeric value for the elevation as measured in meters. 
    The minimum value is -400 with a maximum of 8850. Elevation in feet
    can be approximated by \code{elev * 3.28084}}
  \item{wd}{The angle of wind direction, measured in a clockwise 
    direction, between true north and the direction from which
    the wind is blowing. For example, \code{wd = 90} indicates the 
    wind is blowing from due east. \code{wd = 225} indicates the 
    wind is blowing from the south west. The minimum value is 1, and the
    maximum value is 360.}
  \item{ws}{Wind speed in meters per second.  Wind speed in feet per 
    second can be estimated by \code{ws * 3.28084}}
  \item{ceil_hgt}{The height above ground level of the lowest clould cover
    or other obscuring phenomena amounting to at least 5/8 sky 
    coverate.  Measured in meters.  Unlimited height (no obstruction)
    is denoted by the value 22000}
  \item{temp}{Air temperature measured in degrees Celsius. Conversions 
    to degrees Farenheit may be calculated with 
    \code{(temp * 9) / 5 + 32}}.
  \item{dew_point}{The temperature in degrees Celsius to which a 
    given parcel of air must be cooled at constant pressure and 
    water vapor content in order for saturation to occur.}
  \item{atmos_pres}{The air pressure in hectopascals relative to 
    Mean Sea Level (MSL)}
  \item{rh}{Relative humidity, measured as a percentage,
    as calculated using the August-Roche-Magnus approximation}
  \item{time}{A POSIXct object with the date-time of the observation.}
